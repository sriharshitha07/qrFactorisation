# **SQL query recommendation based on matrix
 factorization**
The primary objective of this study is to enhance
 query processing performance through the integration of sophis
ticated data reduction techniques within databases. Operating
 within the domain of in-database analytics, the focus is on
 evaluating efficient methods for traversing extensive data sets,
 expediting query processing, and deriving valuable insights using
 decomposition techniques, specifically QR decomposition. This
 study aims to achieve two primary goals: firstly, the implementa
tion of decomposition techniques such as QR within a Relational
 Database using SQL as an operator, and secondly, the utilization
 of column pivoting mechanisms on the reduced data for query
 recommendation. This amalgamation serves as an experimental
 pilot space for the innovative hypothesis of integrating Query
 Recommendation through the matrix factorization algorithm,
 QR Factorization using SQL. The core motivation behind the
 In-Database approach for the query recommendation lies in the
 principle that analyzing data where it resides is optimal for the
 most effective analysis. In this context, query recommendation
 within in-database analytics streamlines the process of data anal
ysis and exploration by suggesting appropriate queries derived
 from user behavior. These recommendations are instrumental in
 improving efficiency, providing relevant answers, and optimizing
 the overall analysis.
